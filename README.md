## Rovota Framework

A modern framework written in PHP designed to be reliable, fast and accessible. Thanks to the use of modern language features and elegant architecture, you can build lightning-fast applications with ease.

## System Requirements

* PHP 8.3 or newer.
* MySQL 8+ with InnoDB, MariaDB 10.6+ or PostgreSQL 15+.

## Dependencies

While we try to keep the footprint to a minimum, various dependencies are used to improve functionality and speed up development when reasonably necessary.

Occasionally we may update the used dependencies and/or their minimum versions. Please check the `composer.json` file for up-to-date information on required and suggested dependencies and their version requirements.
